a mlg fishing themed puzzle game inspired by panel de pon, dr mario and tetris.
made with the dankest mlg programming language: Rust.

TODO:

- ~~get a window open~~ (Done (Sort of))
- get something controllable on the window/screen
- ~~find a way to make building the project stable (adding any dependency make the project not build in windows)~~ (Done. Apparently using sdl github repository as a dependency instead of the crates.io dependency will make the code compile)
- learn rust-SDL2
