This projects aim to be a modular synthesizer in which one can code modules that generate or modify sound and then combine those modules in graph-like configurations which will hopefully produce interesting sounds

Most of the interesting code is currently in [moofloom-rs](https://github.com/VoxWave/moofloom-rs) as moomachines will be form the modules of the synthesizer
