# AudioGen

The aim of this project is to create a program that generates various types of sounds. initialy these sounds are outputted to a wav file but I will probably add audio playback in the program itself.

This program is probably not very useful as it's just a pet project type thing on a subject I'm interested in.

{one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.}
